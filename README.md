This Project is developed by Rachesh Sharma and Subhankar Adak

doc2Vec.py:  This file contains the code for the content based recommendation based on Doc2Vec. Installing NLTK and spacy is a prerequisite to run this code. This can be run independently.

tf_idf_based.py: This is for the tf-idf based vector implementation, Installing NLTK is a prerequisite to run the code.

metaDataBased_contentBased: This is the combination of both tf-idf and metadata based. The feature set creation code is commented out. Actual feature set is very large 4.5 GB. We can provide in case needed. This requires high RAM capacity to train.
